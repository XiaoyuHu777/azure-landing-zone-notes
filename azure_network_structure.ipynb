    "# 🌐 Azure Landing Zone: Network Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A robust and modular network structure is essential in any Azure Landing Zone. It ensures secure communication, isolation of workloads, and flexibility for future scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Virtual Network (VNet)\n",
    "- Acts as your private network in the cloud.\n",
    "- Defines the address space using CIDR blocks.\n",
    "- VNets are region-specific and isolated unless connected via peering or gateways.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ *Example*: Create a VNet with the address space `10.0.0.0/16`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Subnets\n",
    "- Logical subdivisions within a VNet.\n",
    "- Used to isolate workloads like frontend, backend, and management.\n",
    "- NSGs can be applied at subnet level for access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ *Example*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Subnet-Web:    10.0.1.0/24\n",
    "- Subnet-DB:     10.0.2.0/24\n",
    "- Subnet-Admin:  10.0.3.0/24\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Network Security Group (NSG)\n",
    "- Used to define inbound and outbound traffic rules.\n",
    "- Acts like a mini-firewall at subnet or NIC level.\n",
    "- Rules can be based on IP ranges, ports, and protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ *Example*: Allow only ports 80 and 443 into the Web subnet; deny public access to DB subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Azure Firewall / Application Gateway\n",
    "- **Azure Firewall**: Controls both east-west and north-south traffic, includes logging and threat intelligence.\n",
    "- **App Gateway**: Provides Layer 7 load balancing and Web Application Firewall (WAF) features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Recommended Architecture: Hub-Spoke Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Hub-Spoke Network Design\n",
    "\n",
    "A scalable enterprise-grade network topology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hub VNet**: Centralized services like VPN Gateway, DNS, Bastion.\n",
    "- **Spoke VNets**: Isolated environments for apps (Dev, Test, Prod).\n",
    "- Spokes do **not** connect directly to each other.\n",
    "- Connected via **VNet Peering** to the Hub.\n",
