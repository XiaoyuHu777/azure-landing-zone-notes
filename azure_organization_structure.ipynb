    "# Azure Landing Zone: Organization Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Azure Cloud Landing Zone, a well-designed organization structure lays the foundation of your architecture. It determines how you manage accounts, resources, access control, and compliance policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Management Groups\n",
    "- Top-level container in Azure\n",
    "- Group multiple subscriptions for centralized management\n",
    "- Useful for assigning policies (Azure Policy) and access control (RBAC)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: Create a \"Production\" management group to manage all production subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subscriptions\n",
    "- A billing unit used to isolate and classify resources\n",
    "- Each subscription has its own billing, quotas, and resource boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: Create separate subscriptions for Dev, Test, and Prod environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource Groups\n",
    "- Logical container for managing deployed resources (e.g., VMs, Storage accounts)\n",
    "- Supports lifecycle and permission management\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: Create a resource group named `rg-webapp-prod` that includes frontend WebApp, database, and monitoring tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper access control is critical. Azure allows permissions to be set at different levels:\n",

    "|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Management Group  | ✅                 | Assign policies and roles across all child subscriptions |\n",
    "| Subscription      | ✅                 | Scope to a specific subscription             |\n",
    "| Resource Group    | ✅                 | Control access to a project or service set   |\n",
    "| Resource          | ✅                 | Fine-grained access to individual resources  |\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: Allow DevOps team to deploy in the Test subscription but restrict access to the Production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "| Best Practice                 | Description                                                    |\n",
    "|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Hierarchical Organization  | Use MGs to separate enterprise units, departments, or projects |\n",
    "| Policy Inheritance         | Apply Azure Policy at top-level MG to enforce compliance       |\n",
    "| Least Privilege Access   | Assign users the minimum permissions they need                 |\n",
    "| Subscription-based Billing | Separate billing for each environment                          |\n",
    "| Naming + Tag Standards     | Apply standard naming and tagging for consistency              |\n",
